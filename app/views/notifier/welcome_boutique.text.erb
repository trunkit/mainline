Here are a few tips to get the most out of Trunkit:

- Curate inventory your customers will love. By offering your customers additional inventory options, you can insure they always leave happy and shop WEEKENDS again and again.
- Supply a few items to get started. When certain inventory isn’t selling well in your store, give another boutique the opportunity to sell that inventory to their customers. It’s a win win :)
- Succeed by collaborating. We’ve chosen you to be one of the first members on Trunkit because we want you to be a trendsetter for other boutiques. By actively curating and supplying inventory, shipping orders on time, and keep quantity of listed inventory up-to-date, your actions will set the tone for all future boutiques that use the service.

Please feel free to contact the Team@Trunkit.com if you have any additional questions or would like to setup a personal lesson on how to use Trunkit.  For more general video tutorials visit help.trunkit.com.

Thanks for joining and congrats on becoming a Trunkit boutique member!

Sam, Max &ampl; the Trunkit Team
