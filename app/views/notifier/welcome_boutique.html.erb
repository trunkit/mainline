<p>Here are a few tips to get the most out of Trunkit:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Curate inventory your customers will love. By offering your customers additional inventory options, you can insure they always leave happy and shop <%= @user.parent.name %> again and again.</li>
  <li>Supply a few items to get started. When certain inventory isn’t selling well in your store, give another boutique the opportunity to sell that inventory to their customers. It’s a win win :)</li>
  <li>Succeed by collaborating. We’ve chosen you to be one of the first members on Trunkit because we want you to be a trendsetter for other boutiques. By actively curating and supplying inventory, shipping orders on time, and keeping quantity of listed inventory up-to-date, your actions will set the tone for all future boutiques that use the service.</li>

<p>Please feel free to contact the Team@Trunkit.com if you have any additional questions or would like to setup a personal lesson on how to use Trunkit. For more general video tutorials visit trunkit.zendesk.com.</p>

<p>Thanks for joining and congrats on becoming a Trunkit boutique member!</p>

<p>Sam, Max &amp; the Trunkit Team</p>
